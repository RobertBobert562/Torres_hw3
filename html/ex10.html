    <h3> let is block scoped and var is not.  What does that mean?</h3>
    <h4>Both of these are used to declare variables. However, 'let' is block scoped meaning that you can only access it inside the block it was declared into. 'var' on the other hand is function scope which means that you can use it within the entire function even if it was declared in another block. You can also use 'var' before it is declared.</h4>
