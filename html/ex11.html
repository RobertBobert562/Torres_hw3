    <h3> What is the output of the following? <br>
        console.log(4 + 5); <br>
        console.log("4 + 5"); <br>
        console.log("4" + "5"); <br>
        console.log(2 + 3 * 5); <br>
        console.log((2 + 3) * 5); <br>
        console.log(10 % 3);</h3>
    <h4>I predict that this program will return 9 on the first line.<br> return 4+5 on the second line.<br> return 45 on the third line.<br> return 17 on the fourth line.<br> return 25 on the fifth line.<br> return 2 on the sixth line. </h4>
    <h5>After executing the program, I was correct for all except the last one which was actually 1. <br> Upon further investigation, I found out that this code calculates the remainder of when '10/3' which is 1.</h5>
