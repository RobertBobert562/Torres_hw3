    <h3> What is the output of the following? <br>
        let a = 2;<br>
        a -= 1;<br>
        a++;<br>
        let b = 8;<br>
        b += 2;<br>
        const c = a + b * b;<br>
        const d = a * b + b;<br>
        const e = a * (b + b);<br>
        const f = a * b / a;<br>
        const g = b / a * a;<br>
        console.log(a, b, c, d, e, f, g);</h3>
    <h4>I predict that the program will output A as 2.<br> B will be 10.<br> C will be 120.<br> D will be 20.<br> E will be 40.<br> F will be 10.<br> Lastly G will be 2.</h4>
    <h5>After running the code, I was correct for A & B along with E & F. I was incorrect for C & D & G. this was because of the order of operations.  </h5>
