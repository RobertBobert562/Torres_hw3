    <h3>Variable Scope: What is the output of the following? <br>
        let num1 = 0;<br>
        {<br>
          num1 = 1; <br>
          const num2 = 0;<br>
        }<br>
        console.log(num1); <br>
        console.log(num2); </h3>
        <h4>I predict that this program will return num1 as 0 and num2 as 0.</h4>
        <h5>After running the program, I realized that num1 would be 1 since it was changed. I thought num1 would not change because it was altered within the block. my prediction would have been correct if num1 was declared again in the block.<br> num2 would return an error because it was declared within the block.</h5>
